# RFClassification
RF Modulation Classification and Protocol Relation

## Setup
### Model Training
Dependencies
- DL: Theano, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenAI Gym, KeRLym
- ML: Scikit-learn, OpenCV, PyOpenPNL, Pandas

Run Jupyter Notebook and run the RF Classification file.

### Dataset Environment
Build the dockerfile provided.

### Data Synthesis
Initialize `build_dataset` file.

## Model
Our generated model can be accessed through the `results_cnn2_d0.5.dat` file.
Without any moduficiation this repository will provide the same file.
